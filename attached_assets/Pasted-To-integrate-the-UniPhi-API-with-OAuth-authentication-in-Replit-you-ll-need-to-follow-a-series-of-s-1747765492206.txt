To integrate the UniPhi API with OAuth authentication in Replit, you'll need to follow a series of steps to set up and manage the authentication flow. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you through the process:
üîê Understanding UniPhi's OAuth Support
UniPhi version 20 introduced support for the Client Credentials OAuth flow, which is intended to replace deprecated authentication methods like Basic Authentication and the Password OAuth flow . This flow is suitable for server-to-server interactions where user consent isn't required.(UniPhi Knowledge)
üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up OAuth in Replit
Obtain OAuth Credentials from UniPhi:
Reach out to your UniPhi administrator to register your application.
You'll receive a Client ID and Client Secret upon successful registration.
Securely Store Credentials in Replit:
In your Replit project, navigate to the Secrets tab.
Add the following environment variables:
UNIPHI_CLIENT_ID
UNIPHI_CLIENT_SECRET
Implement the OAuth Token Request:
Use the Client Credentials flow to obtain an access token. Here's a Python example:(Replit Docs)
 
Replace https://your-uniphi-instance.com/oauth/token with the actual token endpoint provided by UniPhi.
Access UniPhi API Endpoints:
With the obtained access_token, you can make authenticated requests to UniPhi's API. For example:(UniPhi Knowledge)
 
Ensure you replace https://your-uniphi-instance.com/api/endpoint with the specific API endpoint you intend to access.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
Token Expiry: Access tokens typically have an expiration time. Implement logic to refresh tokens as needed.
Secure Storage: Never hardcode your Client Secret in your code. Always use environment variables to store sensitive information.
API Documentation: Consult UniPhi's API documentation for details on available endpoints and required parameters.(UniPhi Knowledge)

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
}
api_url = "https://your-uniphi-instance.com/api/endpoint"
api_response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
data = api_response.json()
import os
import requests
token_url = "https://your-uniphi-instance.com/oauth/token"
client_id = os.environ["UNIPHI_CLIENT_ID"]
client_secret = os.environ["UNIPHI_CLIENT_SECRET"]
response = requests.post(token_url, data={
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret
})
token_data = response.json()
access_token = token_data["access_token"]
