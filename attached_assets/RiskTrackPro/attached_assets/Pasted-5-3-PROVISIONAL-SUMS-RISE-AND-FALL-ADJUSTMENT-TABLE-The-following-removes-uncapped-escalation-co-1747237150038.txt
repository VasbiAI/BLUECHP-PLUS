5.3.	PROVISIONAL SUMS – RISE AND FALL ADJUSTMENT TABLE
The following removes uncapped escalation contractual issues and provides a method to determine a maximum cost for materials, labour and equipment which are agreed at the time of entering the contract and reviewed by BlueCHP’s Quantity Surveyor. This provides BlueCHP with a capped exposure enabling a fixed price with financial incentives for the builder to increase their margin by reducing the cost. 

The below Rise and Fall Adjustment Table incentivises the builder to increase their profit by reducing BlueCHP’s cost.
This is demonstrated below if the price increased from $150 to $200 the builder receives not financial benefit and BlueCHP incurs all the additional cost upto a capped maximum of $200.
However, if the builder was able to reduce the provisional cost from $150 to $100, they would receive 50% of the cost savings.

The construction contract includes the following clause(s) describing the risk share percentages application within the above table, which is attached as an Annexure to the Contract.

The parties agree:

(a) 	the identified provisional sums are based on the Nominated Contract PC Rate set out in Annexure Part [X] for the specified Material Supply Items and form part of the contract sum; 
(b) 	if the actual cost of any Material Supply Item is more than the Nominated Contract PC Rate for that Material Supply Item the Principal will pay the Contractor the total of: 
             
(1)	 100% of the actual cost up to and including the Nominated Contract PC Rate; 
(2)            100% of the actual cost of the Material Supply Item in excess of the Nominated Contract PC Rate up to and including the High Cap Rate; and 
(3)            0% of the actual cost of the Material Supply Item in excess of the High Cap Rate which cost will be borne by the Contractor; and 

(c) if the actual cost of any Material Supply Item is less than the Nominated Contract PC Rate for that Material Supply Item the Principal will pay the Contractor the total of: 

(1)	100% of the actual cost up to and including the Nominated Contact PC Rate but no less than the Low Cap Rate for that Material Supply Item (the Payable Rate); and 
(2)	50% of the difference between the Payable Rate and the Nominated Contract PC Rate.
