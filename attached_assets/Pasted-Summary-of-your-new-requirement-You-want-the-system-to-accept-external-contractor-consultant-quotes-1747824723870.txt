Summary of your new requirement:
You want the system to accept external contractor/consultant quotes (PDF, email, etc.), extract the relevant data using OCR/AI, auto-populate a draft purchase order, and then let the project manager review, amend, and approve before it’s pushed into UniPhi or saved for further processing.

Let’s clarify exactly how this fits into your overall workflow, what technical modules it touches, and how to add this to your ZIP deliverable and requirements matrix.

1. Extended Workflow
Quote Intake:

Upload or email in a contractor/consultant quote (PDF, image, etc.), or monitor a “quotes” mailbox.

AI/OCR Extraction:

System reads the quote, extracts:

Vendor/supplier name

ABN

Contact details

Project reference

Line items (description, qty, price, total)

Validity period, terms

Similar to invoice extraction, but schema slightly differs for quotes/POs.

Draft Purchase Order Creation:

System builds a draft PO object from the extracted data.

Project Manager Review/Edit:

PM sees a draft PO edit screen (editable all fields, flag errors, can add/change line items, supplier details, etc.).

PM can approve, request changes, or decline.

PO Push:

Once approved, the PO is:

Pushed into UniPhi via API (using existing plugin)

OR exported/downloaded/saved externally (for other systems if required)

The original quote, edits, and approval workflow are fully logged.

2. Additions to Requirements Matrix
Req ID	Category	Description	Must/Should	Phase	Module	Notes
R18	Quote Intake	Accept/upload contractor/consultant quotes for PO creation	Must	2	Quote Intake	PDF, image, email support
R19	PO Drafting	AI/OCR reads quote and builds draft PO	Must	2	AI Extraction	New extraction template/schema for quotes
R20	PO Review/Edit	Project manager edits/amends AI-drafted PO before UniPhi push	Must	2	PO Edit UI	Editable form, error highlighting
R21	PO API Push	Push approved PO into UniPhi or export externally	Must	2	UniPhi Plugin	Use or extend current API
R22	Quote/PO Logging	Log original quote, extracted fields, edits, approvals	Must	2	Audit/Workflow	Full traceability for compliance/audit

3. Technical Implementation
A. New Quote Intake & Extraction Module
Extend backend intake to allow “quote” uploads, flag with type: "quote"

Adjust OpenAI prompt for quote-specific fields (supplier, line items, terms, etc.)

Schema: Add quotes table with all extracted fields (like invoices, but for quotes)

B. Draft PO UI
React form shows extracted fields with edit capability (line items as editable table)

Fields: Supplier, ABN, Project, Items, Terms, Attachments, Notes

Show both extracted values and original quote for side-by-side correction if needed

“Approve & Push” and “Save as Draft” buttons

C. UniPhi Integration
On approval, use the UniPhi plugin to create a new PO via API (using mapped fields)

Log response/reference; handle errors/duplicates gracefully

D. Workflow & Logging
Track who made each edit, who approved, and when PO was pushed/exported

Keep both the original quote and the final PO linked for compliance/audit

4. How This Will Look in the Final Deliverable
a) Updated Matrix File
You’ll get these rows added to your requirements.

b) New/Updated Code Stubs:
src/backend/quote_intake_service.ts (handles upload, OCR/AI, and schema save)

src/backend/po_draft_service.ts (handles draft PO, edit/save, push)

src/frontend/QuoteToPODraft.tsx (React edit/review component)

Update src/plugins/uniphi/index.ts to include a createPO() function

c) Business Case/Docs:
A new section in the business case and phased plan covering “Contractor Quote to PO Automation.”
