# Object Storage Implementation Notes

## Current Implementation

The app uses Replit Object Storage for document storage with the `@replit/object-storage` package (v1.0.0).

Integration files:
- `server/bluechp-storage.ts` - Main storage implementation
- `server/storage-utils.ts` - Additional storage utilities

## Future Improvements

1. **Monitor Storage Implementation**: The current implementation appears to be working (upload and download operations show success messages in the logs), but further testing and monitoring may be necessary.

2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for edge cases like network interruptions or service unavailability.

3. **Bucket Management**: Consider implementing bucket management features (listing objects, managing permissions, etc.).

4. **Storage Metrics**: Implement monitoring for storage usage and quotas.

5. **Clean Up Redundant Code**: There are currently two storage implementation files that could be consolidated.

6. **Robust Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanisms for transient failures.

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses the following methods from the Replit Object Storage client:
- `uploadFromFilename` - Uploads a file directly from disk
- `downloadToFilename` - Downloads a file directly to disk
- `delete` - Removes a file from storage

All methods include fallback to local storage in case of failure.
